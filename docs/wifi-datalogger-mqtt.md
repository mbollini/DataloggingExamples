# Datalogging to a Server via MQTT and WiFi

The examples described here log data to a server via WiFi using a network-enabled microcontroller as a datalogging client. They are based on the [WiFi datalogging collection](wifi-datalogger), but instead of HTTP, the microcontroller clients use the [Message Queueing Telemetry Transfer (MQTT)](https://tigoe.github.io/mqtt-examples/) protocol.

These examples should all work on the network-enabled MKR boards, along with the Nano 33 IoT and other SAMD-based boards which have network capability. They can likely work on Espressif-based boards (ESP32, ESP8266) with some modification.

## What is MQTT? 

MQTT, is a lightweight IP-based messaging protocol designed for communication between sensors, controllers, and other devices. Itâ€™s designed to support equipment that may not always be online, or that have limited processing power. Unlike HTTP, it's message-based, so once a client sends a message, there's no need to wait for a response. MQTT server programs are called **brokers**. A broker keeps track of messages from clients. Clients can **publish** messages to a broker on a given topic, or can **subscribe** to an existing topic to see messages from other clients. 

## MQTT Datalogger System Diagram

Figure 1 shows the system diagram for this datalogger. There are several microcontroller-based sensor clients, shown at the top of the diagram that all publish messages to a topic called `light-readings` on an MQTT broker. There are two other clients: a browser-based client written in HTML and JavaScript, and a server-based client written in node.js. The HTML/JS client subscribes to the `light-readings` topic and displays any incoming messages in the browser. The node.js client also subscribes to the `light-readings` topic. When it receives a new message, it makes a HTTP POST request to a Google Script server that posts to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This Google script/spreadsheet combination is the same as what's used in the [Google Sheets Datalogger example](https://tigoe.github.io/DataloggingExamples/wifi-datalogger#google-sheets-datalogger). 

The advantage of using MQTT for this datalogging application is that the microcontrollers don't have to wait for a reply from the server, and can therefore be inactive and using less energy more of the time. It's also simpler to program than an HTTP client.

## MQTT Clients

There are several MQTT microcontroller clients in this repository:
* DataLoggerMqttJSON - the simplest of the clients. Reads a sensor and sends an MQTT message as a JSON object. 
* DataLoggerMqttJSONRTC - similar to the first client, but uses the alarm function of the RTCZero library to control when messages are sent. 
* DataLoggerMqttJSONWithStatusCheck - Based on the first client, and also listens on a UDP port for specific commands that let you check the status of the controller or restart it.
* DataLoggerMqttSubTopics - sends the sensor properties as individual values that are subtopics of the `light-readings` topic rather than as a single JSON object.
