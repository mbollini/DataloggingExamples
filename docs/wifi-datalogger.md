# Datalogging to a Server via WiFi

The examples described here log data to a server via WiFi using the WiFiNINA or WiFi101 library. These should all work on the network-enabled MKR boards, along with the Nano 33 IoT and other M0+ boards which have network capability. 

[This collection](https://github.com/tigoe/DataloggingExamples/tree/master/WiFiDatalogger) includes ArduinoHttpClient examples along with a node.js server script which can be run on any host that can run node.js. There are also instructions for how to log data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet using Google scripts, thanks to Arnab Chakravarty. 

For more on WIFi ArduinoHttpClient examples, see [this repository](https://tigoe.github.io/Wifi101_examples/).
